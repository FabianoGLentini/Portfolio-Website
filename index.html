								<h5>Cafe-Boulange Website</h5>
								<p>Welcome to the Cafe-Boulange website repository! This is a fictional storefront website I designed using Figma and coded using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Some anchor tags, such as the social media icons, are left empty as it is a fictional store. I have plans to enhance the website with additional pages and features in the near future.</p>

								<h5>Design Process</h5>
								<p>Initiated the design process by curating a selection of images from Pexels. Utilized Figma to intricately design the website layout, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing interface. Executed the design implementation by employing a combination of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, bringing the envisioned concept to life on the digital platform.</p>
