# Portfolio Website

## Showcase of My Work

Welcome to my portfolio website repository. This website serves as a showcase for my work and accomplishments. It has been put together using an a HTML5 template from [HTML5](https://html5up.net/). The CSS and HTML of the template has been adjusted for my current needs

### Purpose

While I plan to design and develop a fully customized portfolio website in the near future without the template, I recognized the need for a swift and efficient solution to present my work. Leveraging an existing template allowed me to quickly assemble a functional portfolio that highlights my achievements and skills.

I'm committed to continuously improving and expanding this portfolio, so please feel free to explore my work. If you have any feedback, questions, or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for visiting!
