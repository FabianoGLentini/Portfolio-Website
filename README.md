# Portfolio Website using [HTML5](https://html5up.net/)template

## Functional website to display my work

This website was built using a template from [HTML5](https://html5up.net/). I have adjusted the CSS and html to better suit my current needs.
I plan to design and fully code my portfolio website in the near future, but for the time being, it proved more efficient to quickly put together a portfolio using an existing template.
