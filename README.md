# My Portfolio Website (Under Development)

Welcome to the repository of my portfolio website. This project serves as a showcase for my work and achievements. Currently, I am hosting a temporary website through the "Host" forked branch, created using an [HTML5](https://html5up.net/) template. I've tailored the CSS and HTML of the template to meet my current needs, but the primary focus is on the code for my newly designed website, found in the main branch.

I intend to refine the design, add new pages, and incorporate additional features as the project progresses.
